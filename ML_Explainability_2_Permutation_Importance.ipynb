    "Solution: We cannot tell from the permutation importance results whether traveling a fixed latitudinal distance is more or less expensive than traveling the same longitudinal distance. Possible reasons latitude feature are more important than longitude features 1. latitudinal distances in the dataset tend to be larger 2. it is more expensive to travel a fixed latitudinal distance 3. Both of the above If abs_lon_change values were very small, longitues could be less important to the model even if the cost per mile of travel in that direction were high."
